# Welcome to the Clustering Lab!  READ ME!!!

In today's lab, you have two options:

1. Practice k-Means clustering with seed data (seed as in agricultural seed): `kmeans-clustering-lab.ipynb`
2. Practice DBSCAN with NHL data: `practice-dbscan.ipynb`

> **Note**: the DBSCAN lab is an example where an analysis *does not* work very well.  This is a valuable thing to see, and you will still get to practice DBSCAN in `sklearn`.  I added an "easy dataset" at the very end so that you can verify that the method does indeed work!

**You only need to submit ONE of these labs (whichever you choose).** The other one is left for your edification, to do on your own time (or never!).

*Choose your own adventure*
